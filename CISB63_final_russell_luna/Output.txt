General Principles
The self-image is the key to human personality and human behavior.
Change the self-image and you change the personality and the behavior.
But more than this: The self-image sets the boundaries of individual
accomplishment. It defines what you can and cannot do. Expand the
self-image and you expand the “area of the possible.” The development
of an adequate, realistic self-image will seem to imbue the individual with
new capabilities, new talents, and literally turn failure into success.
Self-image psychology has not only been proven on its own merits,
but it explains many phenomena that have long been known but not
properly understood in the past. For example, there is today irrefutable
clinical evidence in the fields of individual psychology, psychosomatic
medicine, and industrial psychology that there are “success-type
personalities” and “failure-type personalities,” “happiness-prone
personalities” and “unhappiness-prone personalities,” “health-prone
personalities” and “disease-prone personalities.” Self-image psychology
throws new light on these, and many other observable facts of life. It
throws new light on “the power of positive thinking” and, more
importantly, explains why it “works” with some individuals and not with
others. (“Positive thinking” does indeed “work” when it is consistent with
the individual’s self-image. It literally cannot “work” when it is inconsistent
with the self-image—until the self-image itself has been changed.)
In order to understand self-image psychology, and use it in your own
life, you need to know something of the mechanism it employs to
accomplish its goal. There is an abundance of scientific evidence that
shows that the human brain and nervous system operate purposefully in
accordance with the known principles of cybernetics to accomplish goals
of the individual. Insofar as function is concerned, the brain and nervous
system constitute a marvelous and complex “goal-striving mechanism,” a
sort of built-in automatic guidance system that works for you as a
“success mechanism,” or against you as a “failure mechanism,”
depending on how “YOU,” the operator, operate it and the goals you set
for it.
It is also rather ironic that cybernetics, which began as a study of
machines and mechanical principles, goes far to restore the dignity of
man as a unique, creative being. Psychology, which began with the
study of man’s psyche, or soul, almost ended by depriving man of his
soul. The behaviorist, who understood neither the man nor his machine,
and thereby confused the one with the other, told us that thought ismerely the movement of electrons and consciousness merely a chemical
action. “Will” and “purpose” were myths. Cybernetics, which began with
the study of physical machines, makes no such mistake. The science of
cybernetics does not tell us that man is a machine but that man has and
uses a machine. Moreover, it tells us how that machine functions and
how it can be used.
Experiencing Is the Secret
The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, or
by intellectual knowledge alone, but by “experiencing.” Wittingly or
unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing
in the past. You can change it by the same method.
It is not the child who is taught about love but the child who has
experienced love that grows into a healthy, happy, well-adjusted adult.
Our present state of self-confidence and poise is the result of what we
have experienced rather than what we have learned intellectually.
Self-image psychology also bridges the gap and resolves apparent
conflicts between the various therapeutic methods used today. It
furnishes a common denominator for direct and indirect counseling,
clinical psychology, psychoanalysis, and even auto-suggestion. All in one
way or another use creative experiencing to build a better self-image.
Regardless of theories, this is what really happens, for example, in the
“therapeutic situation” employed by the psychoanalytical school. The
analyst never criticizes, disapproves, or moralizes, is never shocked, as
the patient pours out his fears, his shames, his guilt-feelings, and his
“bad thoughts.” For perhaps the first time in his life the patient
experiences acceptance as a human being; he “feels” that his self has
some worth and dignity, and he comes to accept himself, and to
conceive of his “self” in new terms.
Sc i e n c e  D i s c o v e r s  “ Sy n t h e t i c ”  E x p e r i e n c e
Another discovery, this time in the field of experimental and clinical
psychology, enables us to use “experiencing” as a direct and controlled
method of changing the self-image. Actual, real-life experiences can be a
hard and ruthless teacher. Throw a man in water over his head and theexperience may teach him to swim. The same experience may cause
another man to drown. The Army “makes a man” out of many young
boys. But there is no doubting that Army experience also makes many
psycho-neurotics. For centuries it has been recognized that “Nothing
succeeds like success.” We learn to function successfully by
experiencing success. Memories of past successes act as built-in “stored
information,” which gives us self-confidence for the present task. But
how can a person draw upon memories of past successful experiences
when he has experienced only failure? His plight is somewhat
comparable to the young man who cannot secure a job because he has
no experience, and cannot acquire experience because he cannot get a
job.
This dilemma was solved by another important discovery that, for all
practical purposes, allows us to synthesize experience, to literally create
experience and control it, in the laboratory of our minds. Both
experimental and clinical psychology have proved beyond a shadow of a
doubt that the human nervous system cannot tell the difference between
an actual experience and an experience imagined vividly and in detail.
Although this may appear to be a rather extravagant statement, in this
book we will examine some controlled laboratory experiments where this
type of “synthetic” experience has been used in very practical ways to
improve skill in dart throwing and shooting basketball goals. We will see
it at work in the lives of individuals who have used it to improve their skill
in public speaking, overcome fear of the dentist, develop social poise,
develop self-confidence, sell more goods, become more proficient in
chess—and in practically every other conceivable type of situation where
“experience” is recognized to bring success. We will take a look at an
amazing experiment in which two prominent psychologists arranged
things so that neurotics could experience “normally,” and thereby cured
them!
Perhaps most important of all, we will learn how chronically unhappy
people have learned to enjoy life by “experiencing” happiness!

This book has been designed not merely to be read but to be
experienced.You can acquire information from reading a book. But to “experience”
you must creatively respond to information. Acquiring information itself is
passive. Experiencing is active. When you “experience,” something
happens inside your nervous system and your midbrain. New “engrams”
and “neural” patterns are recorded in the gray matter of your brain.
This book has been designed to force you literally to “experience.”
Tailor-made, prefabricated case histories have been kept intentionally to
a minimum. Instead, you are asked to furnish your own “case histories”
by exercising imagination and memory.
I have not supplied summaries at the end of each chapter. Instead,
you are asked to jot down the most important points that appeal to you
as key points that should be remembered. You will digest the information
in this book better if you do your own analysis and summaries of the
chapters.
Finally, you will find throughout the book certain things to do and
certain practice exercises that you are asked to perform. These
exercises are simple and easy to perform, but they must be done
regularly if you are to derive maximum benefit from them.
R e s e r v e  J u d g m e n t  f o r  2 1  D a y s
Do not allow yourself to become discouraged if nothing seems to happen
when you set about practicing the various techniques outlined in this
book for changing your self-image. Instead, reserve judgment—and go
on practicing—for a minimum period of 21 days.
It usually requires a minimum of about 21 days to effect any
perceptible change in a mental image. Following plastic surgery it takes
about 21 days for the average patient to get used to his new face. When
an arm or leg is amputated, the “phantom limb” persists for about 21
days. People must live in a new house for about three weeks before it
begins to “seem like home.” These and many other commonly observed
phenomena tend to show that it requires a minimum of about 21 days for
an old mental image to dissolve and a new one to jell.
Therefore you will derive more benefit from this book if you will secure
your own consent to reserve critical judgment for at least three weeks.
During this time, do not be continually looking over your shoulder, so to
speak, or trying to measure your progress. During these 21 days do notargue intellectually with the ideas presented, do not debate with yourself
as to whether they will work or not. Perform the exercises, even if they
seem impractical to you. Persist in playing your new role, in thinking of
yourself in new terms, even if you seem to yourself to be somewhat
hypocritical in doing so, and even if the new self-image feels a little
uncomfortable or “unnatural.”
You can neither prove nor disprove the ideas and concepts described
in this book with intellectual argument, or simply by talking about them.
You can prove them to yourself by doing them and judging results for
yourself. I am only asking that you reserve critical judgment and
analytical argument for 21 days so that you will give yourself a fair
chance to prove or disprove their validity in your own life.
The building of an adequate self-image is something that should
continue throughout a lifetime. Admittedly we cannot accomplish a
lifetime of growth in three weeks’ time. But you can experience
improvement within three weeks’ time—and sometimes the improvement
is quite dramatic.
W h a t  I s  Su c c e s s ?
Since I use the words “success” and “successful” throughout this book, I
think it is important at the outset to define those terms.
As I use these terms, “success” has nothing to do with prestige
symbols, but with creative accomplishment. Rightly speaking, no man
should attempt to be a “success,” but every man can and should attempt
to be “successful.” Trying to be a “success” in terms of acquiring prestige
symbols and wearing certain badges leads to neuroticism, and
frustration and unhappiness. Striving to be “successful” brings not only
material success, but satisfaction, fulfillment, and happiness.
Noah Webster defined success as “the satisfactory accomplishment
of a goal sought for.” Creative striving for a goal that is important to you
as a result of your own deep-felt needs, aspirations, and talents (and not
the symbols which the “Joneses” expect you to display) brings happiness
as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to
function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is
“built that way,” he is not happy unless he is functioning as he was madeto function—as a goal striver. Thus true success and true happiness not
only go together but each enhances the other.DONE
The Self-Image: Your Key to a Better Life
uring the past decade a revolution has been quietly going on in the
fields of psychology, psychiatry, and medicine.
New theories and concepts concerning the “self” have grown out of
the work and findings of clinical psychologists, practicing psychiatrists,
and cosmetic or so-called plastic surgeons. New methods growing out of
these findings have resulted in rather dramatic changes in personality,
health, and apparently even in basic abilities and talents. Chronic failures
have become successful. “F” students have changed into “straight A”
pupils within a matter of days and with no extra tutoring. Shy, retiring,
inhibited personalities have become happy and outgoing.
Writing in the January 1959 issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, T. F.
James summarizes the results obtained by various psychologists and
MDs as follows:
Understanding the psychology of the self can mean the difference
between success and failure, love and hate, bitterness and
happiness. The discovery of the real self can rescue a crumbling
marriage, recreate a faltering career, and transform victims of
“personality failure.” On another plane, discovering your real self
means the difference between freedom and the compulsions of
conformity.Y o u r  K e y  t o  a  B e t t e r  L i f e
The most important psychological discovery of this century is the
discovery of the “self-image.” Whether we realize it or not, each of us
carries about with us a mental blueprint or picture of ourselves. It may be
vague and ill-defined to our conscious gaze. In fact, it may not be
consciously recognizable at all. But it is there, complete down to the last
detail. This self-image is our own conception of the “sort of person I am.”
It has been built up from our own beliefs about ourselves. But most of
these beliefs about ourselves have unconsciously been formed from our
past experiences, our successes and failures, our humiliations, our
triumphs, and the way other people have reacted to us, especially in
early childhood. From all these we mentally construct a “self” (or a
picture of a self). Once an idea or a belief about ourselves goes into this
picture, it becomes “true,” as far as we personally are concerned. We do
not question its validity, but proceed to act upon it just as if it were true.
This self-image becomes a golden key to living a better life because
of two important discoveries:
1.  A l l  y o u r  a c t i o n s ,  f e e l i n g s ,  b e h a v i o r s — e v e n  y o u r  a b i l i t i e s — a r e
a l w a y s  c o n s i s t e n t  w i t h  t h i s  s e l f - i m a g e . In short, you will “act like” the
sort of person you conceive yourself to be. Not only this, but you literally
cannot act otherwise, in spite of all your conscious efforts or willpower.
The man who conceives himself to be a “failure-type person” will find
some way to fail, in spite of all his good intentions, or his willpower, even
if opportunity is literally dumped in his lap. The person who conceives
himself to be a victim of injustice, one “who was meant to suffer,” will
invariably find circumstances to verify his opinions.
The self-image is a premise, a base, or a foundation upon which your
entire personality, your behavior, and even your circumstances are built.
Because of this our experiences seem to verify, and thereby strengthen,
our self-images and a vicious or a beneficent cycle, as the case may be,
is set up.
For example, a schoolboy who sees himself as an “F”-type student, or
one who is “dumb in mathematics,” will invariably find that his report card
bears him out. He then has “proof.” A young girl who has an image of
herself as the sort of person nobody likes will indeed find that she is
avoided at the school dance. She literally invites rejection. Her
woebegone expression, her hangdog manner, her over-anxiousness to
please, or perhaps her unconscious hostility toward those sheanticipates will affront her—all act to drive away those whom she would
attract. In the same manner, a salesman or a businessman will also find
that his actual experiences tend to “prove” his self-image is correct.
Because of this objective “proof” it very seldom occurs to a person
that his trouble lies in his self-image or his own evaluation of himself. Tell
the schoolboy that he only “thinks” he cannot master algebra, and he will
doubt your sanity. He has tried and tried, and still his report card tells the
story. Tell the salesman that it is only an “idea” that he cannot earn more
than a certain figure, and he can prove you wrong by his order book. He
knows only too well how hard he has tried and failed. Yet, as we shall
see later, almost miraculous changes have occurred both in students’
grades and in the earning capacity of salesmen when they were
prevailed upon to change their self-images.
2.  T h e  s e l f - i m a g e  c a n  b e  c h a n g e d . Numerous case histories have
shown that one is never too young or too old to change his self-image
and thereby start to live a new life.
One of the reasons it has seemed so difficult for a person to change
his habits, his personality, or his way of life has been that heretofore
nearly all efforts at change have been directed to the circumference of
the self, so to speak, rather than to the center. Numerous patients have
said to me something like the following: “If you are talking about ‘positive
thinking,’ I’ve tried that before, and it just doesn’t work for me.” However,
a little questioning invariably brings out that these individuals have
employed “positive thinking,” or attempted to employ it, either on
particular external circumstances, or on some particular habit or
character defect. (“I will get that job,” “I will be more calm and relaxed in
the future,” “This business venture will turn out right for me,” etc.) But
they have never thought to change their thinking about the “self” that was
to accomplish these things.
Jesus warned us about the folly of putting a patch of new material on
an old garment, or of putting new wine into old bottles. “Positive thinking”
cannot be used effectively as a patch or a crutch to the same old self-
image. In fact, it is literally impossible to really think positively about a
particular situation as long as you hold a negative concept of your “self.”
And numerous experiments have shown that once the concept of self is
changed, other things consistent with the new concept of self are
accomplished easily and without strain.
One of the earliest and most convincing experiments along this line
was conducted by the late Prescott Lecky, one of the pioneers in self-image psychology. Lecky conceived of the personality as a “system of
ideas,” all of which must seem to be consistent with one another. Ideas
that are inconsistent with the system are rejected, “not believed,” and not
acted on. Ideas that seem to be consistent with the system are accepted.
At the very center of this system of ideas—the keystone—the base upon
which all else is built, is the individual’s “ego ideal,” his “self-image,” or
his conception of himself. Lecky was a schoolteacher and had an
opportunity to test his theory on thousands of students.
Lecky theorized that if a student had trouble learning a certain
subject, it could be because (from the student’s point of view) it would be
inconsistent for him to learn it. Lecky believed, however, that if you could
change the student’s self-conception, which underlies this viewpoint, his
attitude toward the subject would change accordingly. If the student
could be induced to change his self-definition, his learning ability should
also change. This proved to be the case. One student, who misspelled
55 words out of 100 and flunked so many subjects that he lost credit for
a year, became one of the best spellers in the school and made a
general average of 91 in the next year. A boy who was dropped from one
college because of poor grades entered Columbia and became a straight
“A” student. A girl who had flunked Latin four times, after three talks with
the school counselor, finished with a grade of 84. A boy who was told by
a testing bureau that he had no aptitude for English won honorable
mention the next year for a literary prize.
The trouble with these students was not that they were dumb, or
lacking in basic aptitudes. The trouble was an inadequate self-image (“I
don’t have a mathematical mind”; “I’m just naturally a poor speller”).
They “identified” with their mistakes and failures. Instead of saying “I
failed that test” (factual and descriptive), they concluded, “I am a failure.”
Instead of saying “I flunked that subject,” they said, “I am a flunk-out.”
For those who are interested in learning more about Lecky’s work, I
recommend securing a copy of his book, Self-Consistency: A Theory of
Personality. (Note: This book is now out of print.)
Lecky also used the same method to cure students of such habits as
nail biting and stuttering.
My own files contain case histories just as convincing: the man who
was so afraid of strangers that he seldom ventured out of the house, and
who now makes his living as a public speaker. And there was the
salesman who had already prepared a letter of resignation because he
“just wasn’t cut out for selling,” and six months later was number oneman on a force of 100 salesmen. The minister who was considering
retirement because “nerves” and the pressure of preparing a sermon a
week were getting him down, and now delivers an average of three
“outside talks” a week in addition to his weekly sermons, and doesn’t
know he has a nerve in his body.

I m a g e  Ps y c h o l o g y
Offhand, there would seem to be little or no connection between surgery
and psychology. Yet it was the work of plastic surgeons that first hinted to
me of the existence of the “self-image” and raised certain questions that
led to important psychological knowledge.
When I first began the practice of plastic surgery many years ago, I
was amazed by the dramatic and sudden changes in character and
personality that often resulted when a facial defect was corrected.
Changing the physical image in many instances appeared to create an
entirely new person. In case after case the scalpel that I held in my hand
became a magic wand that not only transformed the patient’s
appearance, but transformed his whole life. The shy and retiring became
bold and courageous. A “moronic,” “stupid” boy changed into an alert,
bright youngster who went on to become an executive with a prominent
firm. A salesman who had lost his touch and his faith in himself became
a model of self-confidence. And perhaps the most startling of all was the
habitual “hardened” criminal who changed almost overnight from an
incorrigible, who had never shown any desire to change, into a model
prisoner who won a parole and went on to assume a responsible role in
society.
I reported many such case histories in my book New Faces, New
Futures. Following its publication, and similar articles in leading
magazines, I was besieged with questions by criminologists,
psychologists, sociologists, and psychiatrists.
They asked questions that I could not answer. But they did start me
upon a search. Strangely enough, I learned as much if not more from my
failures as from my successes.
It was easy to explain the successes, such as the boy with the too-big
ears, who had been told that he looked like a taxicab with both doorsopen. He had been ridiculed all his life—often cruelly. Association with
playmates meant humiliation and pain. Why shouldn’t he avoid social
contacts? Why shouldn’t he become afraid of people and retire into
himself? Terribly afraid to express himself in any way, it was no wonder
he became known as a moron. When his ears were corrected, it would
seem only natural that the cause of his embarrassment and humiliation
had been removed and that he should assume a normal role in life—
which he did.
Or consider the salesman who suffered a facial disfigurement as the
result of an automobile accident. Each morning when he shaved he
could see the horrible disfiguring scar of his cheek and the grotesque
twist to his mouth. For the first time in his life he became painfully self-
conscious. He was ashamed of himself and felt that his appearance
must be repulsive to others. The scar became an obsession with him. He
was “different” from other people. He began to wonder what others were
thinking of him. Soon his ego was even more mutilated than his face. He
began to lose confidence in himself. He became bitter and hostile. Soon
almost all his attention was directed toward himself—and his primary
goal became the protection of his ego and the avoidance of situations
that might bring humiliation. It is easy to understand how the correction
of his facial disfigurement and the restoration of a “normal” face would
overnight change this man’s entire attitude and outlook, his feelings
about himself, and result in greater success in his work.
But what about the exceptions who didn’t change? The duchess who
all her life had been terribly shy and self-conscious because of a
tremendous hump in her nose? Although surgery gave her a classic
nose and a face that was truly beautiful, she still continued to act the part
of the ugly duckling, the unwanted sister who could never bring herself to
look another human being in the eye. If the scalpel itself was magic, why
did it not work on the duchess?
Or what about all the others who acquired new faces but went right on
wearing the same old personality? Or how to explain the reaction of
those people who insist that the surgery has made no difference
whatsoever in their appearance? Every plastic surgeon has had this
experience and has probably been as baffled by it as I was. No matter
how drastic the change in appearance may be, there are certain patients
who will insist that, “I look just the same as before—you didn’t do a
thing.” Friends, even family, may scarcely recognize them, may become
enthusiastic over their newly acquired “beauty,” yet the patientsthemselves insist that they can see only slight or no improvement, or in
fact deny that any change at all has been made. Comparison of “before”
and “after” photographs does little good, except possibly to arouse
hostility. By some strange mental alchemy the patient will rationalize, “Of
course, I can see that the hump is no longer in my nose—but my nose
still looks just the same,” or, “The scar may not show anymore, but it’s
still there.”
Sc a r s  T h a t  B r i n g  Pr i d e  I n s t e a d  o f  S h a m e
Still another clue in search of the elusive self-image was the fact that not
all scars or disfigurements bring shame and humiliation. When I was a
young medical student in Germany, I saw another student proudly
wearing his “saber scar” much as an American might wear the Medal of
Honor. The duelists were the elite of college society, and a facial scar
was the badge that proved you a member in good standing. To these
boys, the acquisition of a horrible scar on the cheek had the same
psychological effect as the eradication of the scar from the cheek of my
salesman patient. In old New Orleans, a Creole wore an eye patch in
much the same way. I began to see that a knife itself held no magical
powers. It could be used on one person to inflict a scar and on another to
erase a scar with the same psychological results.
T h e  M y s t e r y  o f  I m a g i n a r y  U g l i n e s s
To a person handicapped by a genuine congenital defect, or suffering an
actual facial disfigurement as a result of an accident, plastic surgery can
indeed seemingly perform magic. From such cases it would be easy to
theorize that the cure-all for all neuroses, unhappiness, failure, fear,
anxiety, and lack of self-confidence would be wholesale plastic surgery
to remove all bodily defects. However, according to this theory, persons
with normal or acceptable faces should be singularly free from all
psychological handicaps. They should be cheerful, happy, self-confident,
free from anxiety and worry. We know only too well this is not true.Nor can such a theory explain the people who visit the office of a
plastic surgeon and demand a “face-lift” to cure a purely imaginary
ugliness. There are the 35- or 45-year-old women who are convinced
that they look “old” even though their appearance is perfectly “normal”
and in many cases unusually attractive.
There are the young girls who are convinced that they are “ugly”
merely because their mouth, nose, or bust measurement does not
exactly match that of the currently reigning movie queen. There are men
who believe that their ears are too big or their noses too long. No ethical
plastic surgeon would even consider operating on these people, but
unfortunately the quacks, or so-called beauty doctors whom no medical
association will admit to membership, have no such qualms.
Such “imaginary ugliness” is not at all uncommon. A recent survey of
college co-eds showed that 90 percent were dissatisfied in some way
with their appearance. If the words “normal” and “average” mean
anything at all, it is obvious that 90 percent of our population cannot be
“abnormal” or “different” or “defective” in appearance. Yet similar surveys
have shown that approximately the same percentage of our general
population finds some reasoning to be ashamed of their body image.
These people react just as if they suffered from an actual
disfigurement. They feel the same shame. They develop the same fears
and anxieties. Their capacity to really “live” fully is blocked and choked
by the same sort of psychological roadblocks. Their “scars,” though
mental and emotional rather than physical, are just as debilitating.
T h e  Se l f - I m a g e :  T h e  R e a l  S e c r e t
Discovery of the self-image explains all the apparent discrepancies we
have been discussing. It is the common denominator—the determining
factor in all our case histories, the failures as well as the successes.
The secret is this: To really “live,” that is, to find life reasonably
satisfying, you must have an adequate and realistic self-image that you
can live with. You must find your self acceptable to “you.” You must have
a wholesome self-esteem. You must have a self that you can trust and
believe in. You must have a self that you are not ashamed to “be,” and
one that you can feel free to express creatively, rather than hide or cover
up. You must have a self that corresponds to reality, so that you canfunction effectively in a real world. You must know yourself—both your
strengths and your weaknesses—and be honest with yourself
concerning both. Your self-image must be a reasonable approximation of
“you,” being neither more than you are nor less than you are.
When this self-image is intact and secure, you feel good. When it is
threatened, you feel anxious and insecure. When your self-image is
adequate and one that you can be wholesomely proud of, you feel self-
confident. You feel free to “be yourself” and to express yourself. You
function at your optimum. When it is an object of shame, you attempt to
hide it rather than express it. Creative expression is blocked. You
become hostile and hard to get along with.
If a scar on the face enhances the self-image (as in the case of the
German duelist), self-esteem and self-confidence are increased. If a scar
on the face detracts from the self-image (as in the case of the
salesman), loss of self-esteem and self-confidence results.
When a facial disfigurement is corrected by plastic surgery, dramatic
psychological changes result only if there is a corresponding correction
of the mutilated self-image. Sometimes the image of a disfigured self
persists even after successful surgery, much the same as the “phantom
limb” may continue to feel pain years after the physical arm or leg has
been amputated.
I  B e g i n  a  N e w  C a r e e r
These observations led me into a new career. Some years ago I became
convinced that the people who consult a plastic surgeon need more than
surgery and that some of them do not need surgery at all. If I were to
treat these people as patients, as a whole person rather than as merely
a nose, ear, mouth, arm, or leg, I needed to be in a position to give them
something more. I needed to be able to show them how to obtain a
spiritual face-lift, how to remove emotional scars, how to change their
attitudes and thoughts as well as their physical appearance.
This study has been most rewarding. Today I am more convinced
than ever that what each of us really wants, deep down, is more life.
Happiness, success, peace of mind, or whatever your own conception of
supreme good may be, is experienced in its essence as more life. When
we experience expansive emotions of happiness, self-confidence, andsuccess, we enjoy more life. And to the degree that we inhibit our
abilities, frustrate our God-given talents, and allow ourselves to suffer
anxiety, fear, self-condemnation, and self-hate, we literally choke off the
life force available to us and turn our backs on the gift which our Creator
has made. To the degree that we deny the gift of life, we embrace death.

In my opinion, during the past 30 years psychology has become far too
pessimistic regarding man and his potentiality for both change and
greatness. Since psychologists and psychiatrists deal with so-called
abnormal people, the literature is almost exclusively taken up with man’s
various abnormalities, his tendencies toward self-destruction. Many
people, I am afraid, have read so much of this type of thing that they
have come to regard such things as hatred, the “destructive instinct,”
guilt, self-condemnation, and all the other negatives as “normal human
behavior.” The average person feels awfully weak and impotent when he
thinks of the prospect of pitting his puny will against these negative
forces in human nature, in order to gain health and happiness. If this
were a true picture of human nature and the human condition, “self-
improvement” would indeed be a rather futile thing.
However, I believe, and the experiences of my many patients have
confirmed the fact, that you do not have to do the job alone. There is
within each one of us a “life instinct,” which is forever working toward
health, happiness, and all that makes for more life for the individual. This
“life instinct” works for you through what I call the “Creative Mechanism”
or, when used correctly, the “Success Mechanism” built into each human
being.

The new science of cybernetics has furnished us with convincing proof
that the so-called subconscious mind is not a “mind” at all, but a
mechanism—a goal-striving “servo-mechanism” consisting of the brain
and nervous system, which is used by, and directed by the mind. Thelatest and most usable concept is that man does not have two “minds,”
but a mind, or consciousness, that operates an automatic, goal-striving
machine. This automatic, goal-striving machine functions very similarly to
the way that electronic servo-mechanisms function, as far as basic
principles are concerned. But it is much more marvelous, much more
complex, than any computer or guided missile ever conceived by man.

This Creative Mechanism within you is impersonal. It will work
automatically and impersonally to achieve goals of success and
happiness, or unhappiness and failure, depending on the goals that you
yourself set for it. Present it with “success goals,” and it functions as a
Success Mechanism. Present it with negative goals, and it operates just
as impersonally, and just as faithfully, as a Failure Mechanism.

Like any other servo-mechanism, it must have a clear-cut goal,
objective, or “problem” to work on.The goals that our own Creative Mechanism seeks to achieve are
mental images, or mental pictures, which we create by the use of
imagination.
The key goal-image is our self-image.
Our self-image prescribes the limits for the accomplishment of any
particular goals. It prescribes the “area of the possible.”
Like any other servo-mechanism, our Creative Mechanism works on
information and data that we feed into it (our thoughts, beliefs,
interpretations). Through our attitudes and interpretations of situations,
we “describe” the problem to be worked on.
If we feed information and data into our Creative Mechanism to the
effect that we ourselves are unworthy, inferior, undeserving, incapable
(negative self-image), this data is processed and acted on as is any
other data in giving us the “answer” in the form of objective experience.
Like any other servo-mechanism, our Creative Mechanism makes use
of stored information, or “memory,” in solving current problems and
responding to current situations.
Your program for getting more living out of life consists in, first of all,
learning something about this Creative Mechanism, or automatic
guidance system within you and how to use it as a Success Mechanism,
rather than as a Failure Mechanism.
The method itself consists in learning, practicing, and experiencing
new habits of thinking, imagining, remembering, and acting in order to
(1) develop an adequate and realistic self-image, and (2) use your
Creative Mechanism to bring success and happiness in achieving
particular goals.
If you can remember, worry, or tie your shoe, you can succeed.
As you will see later, the method to be used consists of creative
mental picturing, creatively experiencing through your imagination, and
the formation of new automatic reaction patterns by “acting out” and
“acting as if.”
I often tell my patients, “If you can remember, worry, or tie your shoe,
you will have no trouble applying this method.” The things you are called
upon to do are simple, but you must practice and “experience.”
Visualizing (creative mental picturing) is no more difficult than what you
do when you remember some scene out of the past, or worry about the
future. Acting out new action patterns is no more difficult than “deciding,”then following through on tying your shoes in a new and different manner
each morning, instead of continuing to tie them in your old habitual way,
without thought or decision.
