# CISB63_Final
## This is my final project for CISB 63

## Name: Russell Luna

## Date: 12/3/2023

# Project Name: PDF Text Converter and Generation Example

## The goal of this project was to convert a PDF file into a TXT file and generate text using the extracted content.

## It utilized various natural language processing techniques, such as part-of-speech tagging (POS), named entity recognition (NER), translation, frequency distributions, word clouds, and tokenization.

## First, I utilized PyPDF2 to extract the text from the PDF.

##  Then, tokenize the extracted sentences into individual words to identify the most frequently used words and determine the significance of sentences for generating word clouds and TF-IDF scores.

## To enhance entity visualization, I used displacy, which helped visualize entities such as organizations.

## Finally, we used Matplotlib to plot the graph for our frequency distribution (fdist).
